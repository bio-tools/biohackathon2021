A profile is a table of posi\u2010tion\u2010specific scores and gap penalties, providing a generalized description of a protein motif, which can be used for sequence alignments and database searches instead of an individual sequence. A sequence profile is derived from a multiple sequence alignment. We have found 2 ways to improve the sensitivity of sequence profiles: (1) Sequence weights: Usage of individual weights for each sequence avoids bias toward closely related sequences. These weights are automatically assigned based on the distance of the sequences using a published procedure (Sib\u2010bald PR, Argos P, 1990, J Mol Biol 216:813\u2010818). (2) Amino acid substitution table: In addition to the alignment, the construction of a profile also needs an amino acid substitution table. We have found that in some cases a new table, the BLOSUM45 table (Henikoff S, Henikoff JG, 1992, Proc Natl Acud Sci USA 89:10915\u201010919), is more sensitive than the original Dayhoff table or the modified Dayhoff table used in the current implementation. Profiles derived by the improved method are more sensitive and selective in a number of cases where previous methods have failed to completely separate true members from false positives.

It is based exclusively on curated healthy wild-type expression data (e.g., no gene knock-out, no treatment, no disease), to provide a comparable reference of normal gene expression. Curation includes very large datasets such as GTEx (re-annotation of samples as 'healthy' or not) as well as many small ones. Data are integrated and made comparable between species thanks to consistent data annotation and processing, and to calls of presence/absence of expression, along with expression scores. As a result, Bgee is capable of detecting the conditions of expression of any single gene, accommodating any data type and species. Bgee provides several tools for analyses, allowing, e.g., automated comparisons of gene expression patterns within and between species, retrieval of the prefered conditions of expression of any gene, or enrichment analyses of conditions with expression of sets of genes. Bgee release 14.1 includes 29 animal species, and is available at https://bgee.org/ and through its Bioconductor R package BgeeDB.", "date": "2021-01-08T00:00:00Z", "citationCount": 6, "authors":

Searching for model parameters from published literature and models is an essential, yet laborious task. Results: We have developed a new service, BioModels Parameters, to facilitate search and retrieval of parameter values from the Systems Biology Markup Language models stored in BioModels. Modellers can now directly search for a model entity (e.g. a protein or drug) to retrieve the rate equations describing it; the associated parameter values (e.g. degradation rate, production rate, Kcat, Michaelis-Menten constant, etc.) and the initial concentrations. Currently, BioModels Parameters contains entries from over 84,000 reactions and 60 different taxa with cross-references. The retrieved rate equations and parameters can be used for scanning parameter ranges, model fitting and model extension. Thus, BioModels Parameters will be a valuable service for systems biology modellers. Availability and implementation: The data are accessible via web interface and API.

The number of published quantitative models is growing steadily thanks to increasing interest in the use of models as well as the development of improved software systems and the availability of better, cheaper computer hardware. To maximise the benefits of this growing body of models, the field needs centralised model repositories that will encourage, facilitate and promote model dissemination and reuse. Ideally, the models stored in these repositories should be extensively tested and encoded in community-supported and standardised formats. In addition, the models and their components should be cross-referenced with other resources in order to allow their unambiguous identification.Description: BioModels Database http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/ is aimed at addressing exactly these needs. It is a freely-accessible online resource for storing, viewing, retrieving, and analysing published, peer-reviewed quantitative models of biochemical and cellular systems. The structure and behaviour of each simulation model distributed by BioModels Database are thoroughly checked; in addition, model elements are annotated with terms from controlled vocabularies as well as linked to relevant data resources. Models can be examined online or downloaded in various formats. Reaction network diagrams generated from the models are also available in several formats. BioModels Database also provides features such as online simulation and the extraction of components from large scale models into smaller submodels. Finally, the system provides a range of web services that external software systems can use to access up-to-date data from the database.Conclusions: BioModels Database has become a recognised reference resource for systems biology. It is being used by the community in a variety of ways; for example, it is used to benchmark different simulation systems, and to study the clustering of models based upon their annotations. Model deposition to the database today is advised by several publishers of scientific journals. The models in BioModels Database are freely distributed and reusable; the underlying software infrastructure is also available from SourceForge https://sourceforge.net/projects/biomodels/ under the GNU General Public License. \u00a9 2010 Li et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "date": "2010-06-29T00:00:00Z", "citationCount": 397, "authors": [{"name": "Li C."}, {"name": "Donizelli M."}, {"name": "Rodriguez N."}, {"name": "Dharuri H."}, {"name": "Endler L."}, {"name": "Chelliah V."}, {"name": "Li L."}, {"name": "He E."}, {"name": "Henry A."}, {"name": "Stefan M.I."}, {"name": "Snoep J.L."}, {"name": "Hucka M."}, {"name": "Le Novere N."}, {"name": "Laibe C."}], "journal": "BMC Systems Biology"}}, {"doi": "10.1093/nar/gkv1352", "pmid": null, "pmcid": null, "type": [], "version": null, "note": null, "metadata": {"title": "The European Bioinformatics Institute in 2016: Data growth and integration", "abstract": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2015.New technologies are revolutionising biological research and its applications by making it easier and cheaper to generate ever-greater volumes and types of data.

We also launched the Embassy Cloud service, which allows users to run large analyses in a virtual environment next to EMBL-EBI's vast public data resources.", "date": "2016-01-01T00:00:00Z", "citationCount": 79, "authors": [{"name": "Cook C.E."}, {"name": "Bergman M.T."}, {"name": "Finn R.D."}, {"name": "Cochrane G."}, {"name": "Birney E."}, {"name": "Apweiler R."}], "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "credit": [{"name": "BioModels Team", "email": null, "url": null, "orcidid": null, "gridid": null, "rorid": null, "fundrefid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "typeRole": ["Developer"], "note": null}, {"name": "EMBL-EBI", "email": null, "url": null, "orcidid": null, "gridid": null, "rorid": null, "fundrefid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "typeRole": ["Provider"], "note": null}, {"name": null, "email": "biomodels-net-support@lists.sf.net", "url": null, "orcidid": null, "gridid": null, "rorid": null, "fundrefid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "note": null}, {"name": "Camille Laibe", "email": "laibe@ebi.ac.uk", "url": null, "orcidid": null, "gridid": null, "rorid": null, "fundrefid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "note": null}], "community": null, "owner": "ELIXIR-EE", "additionDate": "2017-03-30T21:27:45Z", "lastUpdate": "2021-11-09T09:33:14.827433Z", "editPermission": {"type": "group", "authors": ["rsmsheriff"]}, "validated": 1, "homepage_status": 0, "elixir_badge": 0, "confidence_flag": null}, {"name": "LABRAT", "description": "Lightweight Alignment-Based Reckoning of Alternative Three-prime ends or LABRAT is designed to quantify the usage of alternative polyadenylation and cleavage sites in RNAseq data and identify genes whose usage of these sites varies across experimental conditions.", "homepage": "https://github.com/TaliaferroLab/LABRAT/", "biotoolsID": "labrat", "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:labrat", "version": [], "otherID": [], "relation": [], "function": [{"operation": [{"uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3800", "term": "RNA-Seq quantification"}, {"uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3463", "term": "Expression correlation analysis"}, {"uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0314", "term": "Gene expression profiling"}, {"uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3901", "term": "RNA-binding protein prediction"}, {"uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3891", "term": "Essential dynamics"}], "input": [], "output": [], "note": null, "cmd": null}], "toolType": ["Library"], "topic": [{"uri": "http://edamontology.org/topic_3512", "term": "Gene transcripts"}, {"uri": "http://edamontology.org/topic_3170", "term": "RNA-Seq"}, {"uri": "http://edamontology.org/topic_0203", "term": "Gene expression"}, {"uri": "http://edamontology.org/topic_2640", "term": "Oncology"}, {"uri": "http://edamontology.org/topic_3308", "term": "Transcriptomics"}], "operatingSystem": ["Mac", "Linux", "Windows"], "language": ["Python"], "license": "MIT", "collectionID": [], "maturity": null, "cost": "Free of charge", "accessibility": "Open access", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "elixirCommunity": [], "link": [{"url": "https://github.com/TaliaferroLab/LABRAT/", "type": ["Repository"], "note": null}], "download": [], "documentation": [], "publication": [{"doi": "10.1186/S12864-021-07781-1", "pmid": "34174817", "pmcid": "PMC8234626", "type": [], "version": null, "note": null, "metadata": {"title": "LABRAT reveals association of alternative polyadenylation with transcript localization, RNA binding protein expression, transcription speed, and cancer survival", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The sequence content of the 3' UTRs of many mRNA transcripts is regulated through alternative polyadenylation (APA). The study of this process using RNAseq data, though, has been historically challenging. RESULTS: To combat this problem, we developed LABRAT, an APA isoform quantification method. LABRAT takes advantage of newly developed transcriptome quantification techniques to accurately determine relative APA site usage and how it varies across conditions. Using LABRAT, we found consistent relationships between gene-distal APA and subcellular RNA localization in multiple cell types. We also observed connections between transcription speed and APA site choice as well as tumor-specific transcriptome-wide shifts in APA isoform abundance in hundreds of patient-derived tumor samples that were associated with patient prognosis. We investigated the effects of APA on transcript expression and found a weak overall relationship, although many individual genes showed strong correlations between relative APA isoform abundance and overall gene expression. We interrogated the roles of 191 RNA-binding proteins in the regulation of APA isoforms, finding that dozens promote broad, directional shifts in relative APA isoform abundance both in vitro and in patient-derived samples. Finally, we find that APA site shifts in the two classes of APA, tandem UTRs and alternative last exons, are strongly correlated across many contexts, suggesting that they are coregulated. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that LABRAT has the ability to accurately quantify APA isoform ratios from RNAseq data across a variety of sample types. Further, LABRAT is able to derive biologically meaningful insights that connect APA isoform regulation to cellular and molecular phenotypes.", "date": "2021-06-26T00:00:00Z", "citationCount": 1, "authors": [{"name": "Goering R."}, {"name": "Engel K.L."}, {"name": "Gillen A.E."}, {"name": "Fong N."}, {"name": "Bentley D.L."}, {"name": "Taliaferro J.M."}], "journal": "BMC genomics"}}], "credit": [{"name": "J.
