A critical first step in understanding the role of disordered protein regions in biological function is to identify those disordered regions correctly. Computational methods for disorder prediction have emerged as a core set of tools to guide experiments, interpret results, and develop hypotheses. Given the multiple different predictors available, consensus scores have emerged as a popular approach to mitigate biases or limitations of any single method. Consensus scores integrate the outcome of multiple independent disorder predictors and provide a per-residue value that reflects the number of tools that predict a residue to be disordered. Although consensus scores help mitigate the inherent problems of using any single disorder predictor, they are computationally expensive to generate. They also necessitate the installation of multiple different software tools, which can be prohibitively difficult. To address this challenge, we developed a deep-learning-based predictor of consensus disorder scores. Our predictor, metapredict, utilizes a bidirectional recurrent neural network trained on the consensus disorder scores from 12 proteomes. By benchmarking metapredict using two orthogonal approaches, we found that metapredict is among the most accurate disorder predictors currently available. Metapredict is also remarkably fast, enabling proteome-scale disorder prediction in minutes. Importantly, metapredict is a fully open source and is distributed as a Python package, a collection of command-line tools, and a web server, maximizing the potential practical utility of the predictor. We believe metapredict offers a convenient, accessible, accurate, and high-performance predictor for single-proteins and proteomes alike.","title":"Metapredict: a fast, accurate, and easy-to-use predictor of consensus disorder and structure","authors":[{"name":"Emenecker R.J."},{"name":"Griffith D."},{"name":"Holehouse A.S."}]},"pmid":"34480923","pmcid":"PMC8553642","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.bpj.2021.08.039"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4155-5729","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Alex S.

They carry out important biological functions with multifaceted roles which is also reflected in their evolutionary behavior. Computational methods play important roles in the characterization of IDRs. One of the commonly used disorder prediction methods is IUPred, which relies on an energy estimation approach. The IUPred web server takes an amino acid sequence or a Uniprot ID/accession as an input and predicts the tendency for each amino acid to be in a disordered region with an option to also predict context-dependent disordered regions. In this new iteration of IUPred, we added multiple novel features to enhance the prediction capabilities of the server. First, learning from the latest evaluation of disorder prediction methods we introduced multiple new smoothing functions to the prediction that decreases noise and increases the performance of the predictions. We constructed a dataset consisting of experimentally verified ordered/disordered regions with unambiguous annotations which were added to the prediction. We also introduced a novel tool that enables the exploration of the evolutionary conservation of protein disorder coupled to sequence conservation in model organisms.

The new version also features a consensus annotation and classification for long disordered regions. In order to complement the disorder annotations, MobiDB features additional annotations from external sources. Annotations from the UniProt database include post-translational modifications and linear motifs.

The new version, PED 4.0, has been completely redesigned and reimplemented with cutting-edge technology and now holds about six times more data (162 versus 24 entries and 242 versus 60 structural ensembles) and a broader representation of state of the art ensemble generation methods than the previous version. The database has a completely renewed graphical interface with an interactive feature viewer for region-based annotations, and provides a series of descriptors of the qualitative and quantitative properties of the ensembles. High quality of the data is guaranteed by a new submission process, which combines both automatic and manual evaluation steps. A team of biocurators integrate structured metadata describing the ensemble generation methodology, experimental constraints and conditions. A new search engine allows the user to build advanced queries and search all entry fields including cross-references to IDP-related resources such as DisProt, MobiDB, BMRB and SASBDB.

Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: Disordered flexible linkers (DFLs) are abundant and functionally important intrinsically disordered regions that connect protein domains and structural elements within domains and which facilitate disorder-based allosteric regulation. Although computational estimates suggest that thousands of proteins have DFLs, they were annotated experimentally in <200 proteins. This substantial annotation gap can be reduced with the help of accurate computational predictors. The sole predictor of DFLs, DFLpred, trade-off accuracy for shorter runtime by excluding relevant but computationally costly predictive inputs. Moreover, it relies on the local/window-based information while lacking to consider useful protein-level characteristics. Results: We conceptualize, design and test APOD (Accurate Predictor Of DFLs), the first highly accurate predictor that utilizes both local- and protein-level inputs that quantify propensity for disorder, sequence composition, sequence conservation and selected putative structural properties. Consequently, APOD offers significantly more accurate predictions when compared with its faster predecessor, DFLpred, and several other alternative ways to predict DFLs. These improvements stem from the use of a more comprehensive set of inputs that cover the protein-level information and the application of a more sophisticated predictive model, a well-parametrized support vector machine. APOD achieves area under the curve ¼ 0.82 (28% improvement over DFLpred) and Matthews correlation coefficient ¼ 0.42 (180% increase over DFLpred) when tested on an independent/low-similarity test dataset. Consequently, APOD is a suitable choice for accurate and small-scale prediction of DFLs.","title":"APOD: Accurate sequence-based predictor of disordered flexible linkers","authors":[{"name":"Peng Z."},{"name":"Xing Q."},{"name":"Kurgan L."}]},"pmid":"33381830","pmcid":"PMC7773485","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/BIOINFORMATICS/BTAA808"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Zhenling Peng","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"zhenling@tju.edu.cn","url":null,"typeRole":[]},{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7749-0314","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Lukasz Kurgan","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"lkurgan@vcu.edu","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Kigaard","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:apod","biotoolsID":"apod","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-04-11T09:21:42Z","name":"APOD","topic":[{"term":"Protein disordered structure","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3538"},{"term":"Protein folds and structural domains","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0736"},{"term":"Structure prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0082"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"}],"additionDate":"2021-03-19T08:28:41Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://yanglab.nankai.edu.cn/APOD/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[],"description":"DispHred is server to predict pH-dependent order-disorder transitions in intrinsically disordered proteins.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The natively unfolded nature of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) relies on several physicochemical principles, of which the balance between a low sequence hydrophobicity and a high net charge appears to be critical. Under this premise, it is well-known that disordered proteins populate a defined region of the charge\u2013hydropathy (C\u2013H) space and that a linear boundary condition is sufficient to distinguish between folded and disordered proteins, an approach widely applied for the prediction of protein disorder. Nevertheless, it is evident that the C\u2013H relation of a protein is not unalterable but can be modulated by factors extrinsic to its sequence. Here, we applied a C\u2013H-based analysis to develop a computational approach that evaluates sequence disorder as a function of pH, assuming that both protein net charge and hydrophobicity are dependent on pH solution. On that basis, we developed DispHred, the first pH-dependent predictor of protein disorder. Despite its simplicity, DispHred displays very high accuracy in identifying pH-induced order/disorder protein transitions. DispHred might be useful for diverse applications, from the analysis of conditionally disordered segments to the synthetic design of disorder tags for biotechnological applications. Importantly, since many disorder predictors use hydrophobicity as an input, the here developed framework can be implemented in other state-of-the-art algorithms.","title":"Disphred: A server to predict ph-dependent order\u2013disorder transitions in intrinsically disordered proteins","authors":[{"name":"Santos J."},{"name":"Iglesias V."},{"name":"Pintado C."},{"name":"Santos-Suarez J."},{"name":"Ventura S."}]},"pmid":"32823616","pmcid":"PMC7461198","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.3390/IJMS21165814"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9652-6351","typeEntity":"Person","name":"Salvador Ventura","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"Salvador.ventura@uab.es","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Kigaard","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:disphred","biotoolsID":"disphred","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-03-01T09:43:28Z","name":"DispHred","topic":[{"term":"Protein disordered structure","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3538"},{"term":"Protein folds and structural domains","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0736"},{"term":"Machine learning","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3474"},{"term":"Protein properties","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0123"},{"term":"Small molecules","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0154"}],"additionDate":"2021-01-18T10:28:04Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://ppmclab.pythonanywhere.com/DispHred"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Other"],"url":"http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/DisoRDPbind/"}],"description":"DisoRDPbind is a web predictor of disorder-mediated RNA, DNA and protein binding regions.

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) constitutively expose their aggregation determinants to the solvent, thus being especially sensitive to its fluctuations. However, solvent conditions are often disregarded in computational aggregation predictors. We recently developed a phenomenological model to predict IDPs' solubility as a function of the solution pH, which is based on the assumption that both protein lipophilicity and charge depend on this parameter. The model anticipated solubility changes in different IDPs accurately. In this application note, we present SolupHred, a web-based interface that implements the aforementioned theoretical framework into a predictive tool able to compute IDPs aggregation propensities as a function of pH. SolupHred is the first dedicated software for the prediction of pH-dependent protein aggregation.

Published by Oxford University Press.As an important type of proteins, intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDPs/IDRs) are related to many crucial biological functions. Accurate prediction of IDPs/IDRs is beneficial to the prediction of protein structures and functions. Most of the existing methods ignore the fully ordered proteins without IDRs during training and test processes. As a result, the corresponding predictors prefer to predict the fully ordered proteins as disordered proteins. Unfortunately, these methods were only evaluated on datasets consisting of disordered proteins without or with only a few fully ordered proteins, and therefore, this problem escapes the attention of the researchers. However, most of the newly sequenced proteins are fully ordered proteins in nature. These predictors fail to accurately predict the ordered and disordered proteins in real-world applications. In this regard, we propose a new method called RFPR-IDP trained with both fully ordered proteins and disordered proteins, which is constructed based on the combination of convolution neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM). The experimental results show that although the existing predictors perform well for predicting the disordered proteins, they tend to predict the fully ordered proteins as disordered proteins. In contrast, the RFPR-IDP predictor can correctly predict the fully ordered proteins and outperform the other 10 state-of-the-art methods when evaluated on a test dataset with both fully ordered proteins and disordered proteins.

The continuous accumulation of nsSNVs resulted from the wide application of NGS has driven the development of disease-association prediction methods for decades. However, their performance on nsSNVs in IDRs remains inferior, possibly due to the domination of nsSNVs from structured regions in training data. Therefore, it is highly demanding to build a disease-association predictor specifically for nsSNVs in IDRs with better performance. Results: We present IDRMutPred, a machine learning-based tool specifically for predicting disease-associated germline nsSNVs in IDRs. Based on 17 selected optimal features that are extracted from sequence alignments, protein annotations, hydrophobicity indices and disorder scores, IDRMutPred was trained using three ensemble learning algorithms on the training dataset containing only IDR nsSNVs.

Accurate prediction of IDRs is critical for the protein structure and function analysis. However, the existing computational methods construct the predictive models solely in the sequence space, failing to convert the sequence space into the 'semantic space' to reflect the structure characteristics of proteins. Furthermore, although the length-dependent predictors showed promising results, new fusion strategies should be explored to improve their predictive performance and the generalization. Results: In this study, we applied the Sequence to Sequence Learning (Seq2Seq) derived from natural language processing (NLP) to map protein sequences to 'semantic space' to reflect the structure patterns with the help of predicted residue-residue contacts (CCMs) and other sequence-based features. Furthermore, the Attention mechanism was used to capture the global associations between all residue pairs in the proteins. Three length-dependent predictors were constructed: IDP-Seq2Seq-L for long disordered region prediction, IDP-Seq2Seq-S for short disordered region prediction and IDP-Seq2Seq-G for both long and short disordered region predictions. Finally, these three predictors were fused into one predictor called IDP-Seq2Seq to improve the discriminative power and generalization. Experimental results on four independent test datasets and the CASP test dataset showed that IDP-Seq2Seq is insensitive with the ratios of long and short disordered regions and outperforms other competing methods.","title":"IDP-Seq2Seq: Identification of intrinsically disordered regions based on sequence to sequence learning","authors":[{"name":"Tang Y.-J."},{"name":"Pang Y.-H."},{"name":"Liu B."}]},"pmid":"32702119","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/BIOINFORMATICS/BTAA667"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Bin Liu","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"bliu@bliulab.net","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Niclaskn","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web service"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:idp-seq2seq","biotoolsID":"idp-seq2seq","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-02-03T07:25:46Z","name":"IDP-Seq2Seq","topic":[{"term":"Natural language processing","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0218"},{"term":"Protein disordered structure","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3538"},{"term":"Protein expression","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0108"},{"term":"Machine learning","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3474"}],"additionDate":"2021-01-18T09:50:32Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://bliulab.net/IDP-Seq2Seq/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"Dichotomy of sequence-based methods developed using structured complexes versus disordered proteins.\n\nhybridPBRpred - web server from Biomine lab.\n\nHybridPBRpred combines prediction of protein-binding residues generated by SCRIBER (predictor that was trained using structures of protein-protein complexes) and DisoRDPbind (predictor that was trained using disordered protein-binding residues), with the underlying goal to produce complete set of the protein-binding residues.","language":[],"operatingSystem":[],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":0,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Protein disorder prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3904"},{"term":"Protein structure prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0474"},{"term":"Protein secondary structure prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0267"},{"term":"Residue contact prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0272"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2020-09-15T00:00:00Z","citationCount":4,"journal":"Bioinformatics","abstract":"© 2020 Oxford University Press.

They use either structure-Annotated or disorder-Annotated training datasets, potentially creating a dichotomy where the structure-/ disorder-specific models may not be able to cross-over to accurately predict the other type. Moreover, the structuretrained predictors were shown to substantially cross-predict PBRs among residues that interact with non-protein partners (nucleic acids and small ligands). We address these issues by performing first-of-its-kind comparative study of a representative collection of disorder-and structure-Trained predictors using a comprehensive benchmark set with the structure-and disorder-derived annotations of PBRs (to analyze the cross-over) and the protein-, nucleic acid-and small ligand-binding proteins (to study the cross-predictions). Results: Three predictors provide accurate results: SCRIBER, ANCHOR and disoRDPbind. Some of the structuretrained methods make accurate predictions on the structure-Annotated proteins. Similarly, the disorder-Trained predictors predict well on the disorder-Annotated proteins. However, the considered predictors generally fail to crossover, with the exception of SCRIBER. Our study also reveals that virtually all methods substantially cross-predict PBRs, except for SCRIBER for the structure-Annotated proteins and disoRDPbind for the disorder-Annotated proteins. We formulate a novel hybrid predictor, hybridPBRpred, that combines results produced by disoRDPbind and SCRIBER to accurately predict disorder-and structure-Annotated PBRs. HybridPBRpred generates accurate results that cross-over structure-and disorder-Annotated proteins and produces relatively low amount of cross-predictions, offering an accurate alternative to predict PBRs.","title":"Prediction of protein-binding residues: Dichotomy of sequence-based methods developed using structured complexes versus disordered proteins","authors":[{"name":"Zhang J."},{"name":"Ghadermarzi S."},{"name":"Kurgan L."}]},"pmid":"32860044","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1093/BIOINFORMATICS/BTAA573"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Lukasz Kurgan","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"lkurgan@vcu.edu","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"Niclaskn","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web service"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:hybridpbrpred","biotoolsID":"hybridpbrpred","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2021-02-01T08:55:34Z","name":"hybridPBRpred","topic":[{"term":"Protein disordered structure","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3538"},{"term":"Structure prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0082"},{"term":"Protein interactions","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0128"}],"additionDate":"2021-01-18T10:25:12Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu/servers/hybridPBRpred/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Repository"],"url":"https://github.com/roneshsharma/MoRFpred-plus"}],"description":"Identifying Molecular Recognition Features in Intrinsically Disordered Regions of Proteins by Transfer Learning | AVAILABILITY HTML server, please click here.

All rights reserved.Motivation: Protein intrinsic disorder describes the tendency of sequence residues to not fold into a rigid three-dimensional shape by themselves. However, some of these disordered regions can transition from disorder to order when interacting with another molecule in segments known as molecular recognition features (MoRFs). Previous analysis has shown that these MoRF regions are indirectly encoded within the prediction of residue disorder as low-confidence predictions [i.e. in a semi-disordered state P(D)≈0.5]. Thus, what has been learned for disorder prediction may be transferable to MoRF prediction. Transferring the internal characterization of protein disorder for the prediction of MoRF residues would allow us to take advantage of the large training set available for disorder prediction, enabling the training of larger analytical models than is currently feasible on the small number of currently available annotated MoRF proteins. In this paper, we propose a new method for MoRF prediction by transfer learning from the SPOT-Disorder2 ensemble models built for disorder prediction. Results: We confirm that directly training on the MoRF set with a randomly initialized model yields substantially poorer performance on independent test sets than by using the transfer-learning-based method SPOT-MoRF, for both deep and simple networks. Its comparison to current state-of-the-art techniques reveals its superior performance in identifying MoRF binding regions in proteins across two independent testing sets, including our new dataset of >800 protein chains. These test chains share <30% sequence similarity to all training and validation proteins used in SPOT-Disorder2 and SPOT-MoRF, and provide a much-needed large-scale update on the performance of current MoRF predictors.

While the growing number of predictors is a positive trend, we have observed a considerable difference in predictive quality among predictors for individual proteins. Furthermore, variable predictor performance is often inconsistent between predictors for different proteins, and the predictor that shows the best predictive performance depends on the unique properties of each protein sequence. We propose a computational approach, DISOselect, to estimate the predictive performance of 12 selected predictors for individual proteins based on their unique sequence-derived properties. This estimation informs the users about the expected predictive quality for a selected disorder predictor and can be used to recommend methods that are likely to provide the best quality predictions. Our solution does not depend on the results of any disorder predictor; the estimations are made based solely on the protein sequence. Our solution significantly improves predictive performance, as judged with a test set of 1,000 proteins, when compared to other alternatives. We have empirically shown that by using the recommended methods the overall predictive performance for a given set of proteins can be improved by a statistically significant margin.

Many freely available computational methods have been developed to predict regions of intrinsic disorder from the primary sequence of a protein, including our recently developed Rosetta ResidueDisorder. While these methods are very useful, they are only designed to predict intrinsic disorder from the sequence. However, it would be useful to have a method that could also measure intrinsic disorder directly from structure. Such a method might also be used to identify changes in the structure of systems that can transition from folded to unfolded or vice versa, even systems that are not intrinsically disordered. Here we extended the capabilities of Rosetta ResidueDisorder to measure the intrinsic disorder from the coordinates of a single conformation of a protein. As a proof of principle, we show that ResidueDisorder can measure the intrinsic disorder from the coordinates with a higher accuracy (69.2%) than when predicted from sequence (65.4%) using a benchmark set of 229 proteins, showing that intrinsic disorder can be measured accurately from single structures over a large range of intrinsic disorder (0-100%). Additionally, we used ResidueDisorder to analyze unfolding trajectories of 12 fast-folding, nonintrinsically disordered proteins generated using molecular dynamics (MD), specifically steered MD (SMD), higherature MD, and accelerated MD (aMD) as well as long-time scale folding/unfolding trajectories. Using ResidueDisorder, a clear correlation between RMSD with respect to the native structure and measured fraction of denatured residues was observed. Finally, we introduced methods to predict folding/unfolding transitions as well as a native-like structure in the absence of a crystal structure from folding/unfolding MD trajectories. Rosetta ResidueDisorder is available as an application in the Rosetta software suite with the addition of new capabilities for directly identifying denatured regions and predicting events.","title":"Measuring Intrinsic Disorder and Tracking Conformational Transitions Using Rosetta ResidueDisorder","authors":[{"name":"Seffernick J.T."},{"name":"Ren H."},{"name":"Kim S.S."},{"name":"Lindert S."}]},"pmid":"31411026","pmcid":"PMC6748046","type":[],"version":null,"doi":"10.1021/ACS.JPCB.9B04333"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Steffen Lindert","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"lindert.1@osu.edu","url":null,"typeRole":[]}],"editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"owner":"Pub2Tools","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":"tool","documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":[],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ResidueDisorder","biotoolsID":"ResidueDisorder","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2020-12-13T14:49:47Z","name":"ResidueDisorder","topic":[{"term":"Protein disordered structure","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3538"},{"term":"Protein folds and structural domains","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0736"},{"term":"Protein folding, stability and design","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0130"}],"additionDate":"2019-11-14T18:36:16Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/ResidueDisorder"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":"Open access","link":[],"description":"Tool for high-throughput analysis of intrinsic disorder patterns in homologous proteins.","language":["Python"],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[{"note":null,"type":"Downloads page","version":null,"url":"https://basilisc.com/downloads/"}],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Visualisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0337"},{"term":"Protein property calculation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0250"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2018-12-11T00:00:00Z","citationCount":0,"journal":"BMC Genomics","abstract":"© 2018 The Author(s).Background: Intrinsic structural disorder is a common property of many proteins, especially in eukaryotic and virus proteomes. The tendency of some proteins or protein regions to exist in a disordered state usually precludes their structural characterisation and renders them especially difficult for experimental handling after recombinant expression. Results: A new intuitive, publicly-available computational resource, called BASILIScan, is presented here. It provides a BLAST-based search for close homologues of the protein of interest, integrated with a simultaneous prediction of intrinsic disorder together with a robust data viewer and interpreter. This allows for a quick, high-throughput screening, scoring and selection of closely-related yet highly structured homologues of the protein of interest. Comparative parallel analysis of the conservation of extended regions of disorder in multiple sequences is also offered. The use of BASILIScan and its capacity for yielding biologically applicable predictions is demonstrated. Using a high-throughput BASILIScan screen it is also shown that a large proportion of the human proteome displays homologous sequences of superior intrinsic structural order in many related species. Conclusion: Through the swift identification of intrinsically stable homologues and poorly conserved disordered regions by the BASILIScan software, the chances of successful recombinant protein expression and compatibility with downstream applications such as crystallisation can be greatly increased.","title":"BASILIScan: A tool for high-throughput analysis of intrinsic disorder patterns in homologous proteins","authors":[{"name":"Barski M."}]},"pmid":"30537929","pmcid":"PMC6290515","type":["Primary"],"version":null,"doi":"10.1186/s12864-018-5322-5"}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"M.

Automatic prediction of disordered regions from protein sequences is an important problem in the study of structural biology. The proposed classifier DisPSSMP2 is different from several existing disorder predictors by its employment of position-specific scoring matrices with respect to physicochemical properties (PSSMP), where the physicochemical properties adopted here especially take the disorder propensity of amino acids into account. The web server iPDA integrates DisPSSMP2 with several other sequence predictors in order to investigate the functional role of the detected disordered region. The predicted information includes sequence conservation, secondary structure, sequence complexity and hydrophobic clusters. According to the proportion of the secondary structure elements predicted, iPDA dynamically adjusts the cutting threshold of determining protein disorder. Furthermore, a pattern mining package for detecting sequence conservation is embedded in iPDA for discovering potential binding regions of the query protein, which is really helpful to uncovering the relationship between protein function and its primary sequence.

Previous studies reveal that disordered regions of a protein can be predicted by its primary structure, the amino acid sequence. One observation that has been widely accepted is that ordered regions usually have compositional bias toward hydrophobic amino acids, and disordered regions are toward charged amino acids. Recent studies further show that employing evolutionary information such as position specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) improves the prediction accuracy of protein disorder. As more and more machine learning techniques have been introduced to protein disorder detection, extracting more useful features with biological insights attracts more attention. Results: Thi s paper first studies the effect of a condensed position specific scoring matrix with respect to physicochemical properties (PSSMP) on the prediction accuracy, where the PSSMP is derived by merging several amino acid columns of a PSSM belonging to a certain property into a single column. Next, we decompose each conventional physicochemical property of amino acids into two disjoint groups which have a propensity for order and disorder respectively, and show by experiments that some of the new properties perform better than their parent properties in predicting protein disorder. In order to get an effective and compact feature set on this problem, we propose a hybrid feature selection method that inherits the efficiency of uni-variant analysis and the effectiveness of the stepwise feature selection that explores combinations of multiple features. The experimental results show that the selected feature set improves the performance of a classifier built with Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN) in comparison with the feature set constructed with PSSMs or PSSMPs that adopt simply the conventional physicochemical properties. Conclusion: Distinguishing disordered regions from ordered regions in protein sequences facilitates the exploration of protein structures and functions. Results based on independent testing data reveal that the proposed predicting model DisPSSMP performs the best among several of the existing packages doing similar tasks, without either under-predicting or over-predicting the disordered regions. Furthermore, the selected properties are demonstrated to be useful in finding discriminating patterns for order/disorder classification. © 2006 Su et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","title":"Protein disorder prediction by condensed PSSM considering propensity for order or disorder","authors":[{"name":"Su C.-T."},{"name":"Chen C.-Y."},{"name":"Ou Y.-Y."}]},"pmid":"16796745","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":null}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Chien-Yu Chen","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"cychen@mars.csie.ntu.edu.tw","url":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"ELIXIR-EE","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Web application"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ipda","biotoolsID":"ipda","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2018-12-10T12:58:56Z","name":"iPDA","topic":[{"term":"Protein disordered structure","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3538"},{"term":"Proteins","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0078"},{"term":"Sequence composition, complexity and repeats","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0157"},{"term":"Protein sites, features and motifs","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3510"},{"term":"Reproductive health","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3420"}],"additionDate":"2017-02-14T09:35:48Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://biominer.bime.ntu.edu.tw/ipda/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[],"description":"PrDOS (Protein Disorder Prediction Server) is a server to predict the disordered regions of a protein from its amino acid sequence.","language":[],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Protein secondary structure prediction (coils)","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0470"},{"term":"Residue interaction prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0272"},{"term":"Protein feature detection","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3092"},{"term":"Protein secondary structure prediction","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0267"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2007-07-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":464,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","abstract":"PrDOS is a server that predicts the disordered regions of a protein from its amino acid sequence (http://prdos.hgc.jp).

Analysing 31 entirely sequenced organisms, we predicted five times as many proteins with NORS regions (loopy proteins) in eukaryotes (20%) than in prokaryotes and archaeas (4%). Thousands of these NORS regions were over 150 residues long. The amino acid composition of NORS regions differed from that of loops in PDB. Although NORS proteins had significantly more residues in low-complexity regions than other proteins, simple cut-off thresholds for sequence bias missed most NORS regions. On average, NORS regions were evolutionarily at least as conserved as their flanking regions. Furthermore, yeast proteins with NORS regions had more protein-protein interaction partners than other proteins. Regulatory and transcription-related functions were over-represented in loopy proteins, biosynthesis and energy metabolism were under-represented.

The information in IDEAL is provided on a user-friendly graphical view and in a computer-friendly XML format. © The Author(s) 2011.","title":"IDEAL: Intrinsically disordered proteins with extensive annotations and literature","authors":[{"name":"Fukuchi S."},{"name":"Sakamoto S."},{"name":"Nobe Y."},{"name":"Murakami S.D."},{"name":"Amemiya T."},{"name":"Hosoda K."},{"name":"Koike R."},{"name":"Hiroaki H."},{"name":"Ota M."}]},"pmid":"22067451","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":null}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":"Satoshi Fukuchi","rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"sfukuchi@maebashi-it.ac.jp","url":"http://www.ideal.force.cs.is.nagoya-u.ac.jp/IDEAL/contact.html","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"ELIXIR-EE","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["General"],"url":"http://www.ideal.force.cs.is.nagoya-u.ac.jp/IDEAL/help_main.html"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Database portal"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ideal","biotoolsID":"ideal","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2018-12-10T12:58:50Z","name":"IDEAL","topic":[{"term":"Protein modifications","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0601"},{"term":"Protein disordered structure","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3538"},{"term":"Protein folds and structural domains","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0736"},{"term":"Proteins","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0078"},{"term":"Protein binding sites","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3534"}],"additionDate":"2017-03-30T23:00:05Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://www.ideal.force.cs.is.nagoya-u.ac.jp/IDEAL/"},{"otherID":[],"accessibility":null,"link":[{"note":null,"type":["Software catalogue"],"url":"http://www.mybiosoftware.com/rapid-regression-based-accurate-prediction-of-protein-intrinsic-disorder-content.html"}],"description":"Server providing fast and accurate sequence based prediction of protein disorder content.","language":[],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"relation":[],"homepage_status":0,"download":[],"validated":1,"function":[{"output":[],"input":[],"note":null,"cmd":null,"operation":[{"term":"Protein sequence analysis","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}]}],"publication":[{"note":null,"metadata":{"date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":36,"journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta - Proteins and Proteomics","abstract":"Recent research in the protein intrinsic disorder was stimulated by the availability of accurate computational predictors. However, most of these methods are relatively slow, especially considering proteome-scale applications, and were shown to produce relatively large errors when estimating disorder at the protein- (in contrast to residue-) level, which is defined by the fraction/content of disordered residues. To this end, we propose a novel support vector Regression-based Accurate Predictor of Intrinsic Disorder (RAPID). Key advantages of RAPID are speed (prediction of anaverage-size eukaryotic proteome takes <1 hon a modern desktop computer); sophisticated design (multiple, complementary information sources that are aggregated over an input chain are combined using feature selection); and high-quality and robust predictive performance. Empirical tests on two diverse benchmark datasets reveal that RAPID's predictive performance compares favorably to a comprehensive set of state-of-the-art disorder and disorder content predictors. Drawing on high speed and good predictive quality, RAPID was used to perform large-scale characterization of disorder in 200+ fully sequenced eukaryotic proteomes. Our analysis reveals interesting relations of disorder with structural coverage and chain length, and unusual distribution of fully disordered chains. We also performed a comprehensive (using 56000+ annotated chains, which doubles the scope of previous studies) investigation of cellular functions and localizations that are enriched inthe disorder in the human proteome.

Recent studies suggest that short protein regions trigger this aggregation. Thus, identifying these short peptides is critical for understanding diseases and finding potential therapeutic targets. Results: We propose a method, named Pafig (Prediction of amyloid fibril-forming segments) based on support vector machines, to identify the hexpeptides associated with amyloid fibrillar aggregates. The features of Pafig were obtained by a two-round selection from AAindex. Using a 10-fold cross validation test on Hexpepset dataset, Pafig performed well with regards to overall accuracy of 81% and Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.63. Pafig was used to predict the potential fibril-forming hexpeptides in all of the 64,000,000 hexpeptides. As a result, approximately 5.08% of hexpeptides showed a high aggregation propensity. In the predicted fibril-forming hexpeptides, the amino acids - alanine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, leucine and valine occurred at the higher frequencies and the amino acids - aspartic acid, glutamic acid, histidine, lysine, arginine and praline, appeared with lower frequencies. Conclusion: The performance of Pafig indicates that it is a powerful tool for identifying the hexpeptides associated with fibrillar aggregates and will be useful for large-scale analysis of proteomic data. © 2009 Tian et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","title":"Prediction of amyloid fibril-forming segments based on a support vector machine","authors":[{"name":"Tian J."},{"name":"Wu N."},{"name":"Guo J."},{"name":"Fan Y."}]},"pmid":"19208147","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"doi":null}],"elixirNode":[],"elixirPlatform":[],"credit":[{"note":null,"orcidid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","name":null,"rorid":null,"gridid":null,"fundrefid":null,"email":"tianjian3721@163.com","url":"http://www.mobioinfor.cn/","typeRole":["Primary contact"]}],"editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"owner":"mbs_import","cost":null,"maturity":null,"confidence_flag":null,"documentation":[{"note":null,"type":["User manual"],"url":"http://www.mobioinfor.cn/pafig/quickhelp.htm"}],"community":null,"version":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"license":null,"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pafig","biotoolsID":"pafig","elixirCommunity":[],"elixir_badge":0,"lastUpdate":"2018-12-10T12:58:44Z","name":"Pafig","topic":[{"term":"Proteins","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0078"},{"term":"Pathology","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0634"},{"term":"Infectious disease","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3324"},{"term":"Protein disordered structure","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3538"}],"additionDate":"2017-08-03T18:55:03Z","collectionID":[],"homepage":"http://www.mobioinfor.cn/pafig/index.htm"}]
